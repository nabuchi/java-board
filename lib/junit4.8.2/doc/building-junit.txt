Steps to build junit:

- Must be manual
  - Write release notes
  - Update version in build.xml and pom.xml
- Not too tedious:
  - Run the ant zip task
  - Upload stuff to github (including tag)
- Tedious:
  - Update SourceForge if major release
  - Update javadocs on github site (and "latest" link)
  - Update javadocs on junit.org
  - Put release notes on github.
  - Do something with maven.
  - Announce on blog, user list, dev list, announce list, junit.org, twitter 
- Profit!
